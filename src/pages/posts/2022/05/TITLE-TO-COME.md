**Note**: Although it's unrelated to the subject of this piece, you may be interested to know that I wrote this, at least in part, using the [v.5 beta version](https://multimarkdown.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4606313740051-Where-to-download-the-beta-) of the venerable [MultiMarkdown Composer](https://multimarkdown.com/). At the same time, it appears that the equally venerable [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) [will soon reach v.6](https://twitter.com/iAWriter/status/1522306304492118018), about four years after the release of v.5.
